# Monte Carlo Basic

This project is intended to showcase a basic Monte Carlo simulation implementation in Python. It can simulation underlying price movements for multiple stocks, having a few basic additions beyond a plain vanilla implementation that allow for more realistic and useful results.

# Features

In addition to the most basic and fundamental features, this Monte Carlo simulation accounts for underlying:

1.1) Skew
1.2) Kurtosis
3) Correlations

It also gives the option for changing 

# Simulation Units

This simulates underlying price movements in days, rather than in time periods shorter or longer than a day.
